# Huffman_Code
# This program focuses on nodes, priority queues, and tree manipulation, maps, string, files, and 
# program coding in general.
# TextToCode.java
# This program will require a customized node class. 
# This program will ask the user for the name of a text file to read, and will then 
# generate the Huffman Code for that document, and the print off two files.
# The first file will be the code itself.
# The second file will be the encoded file after applying the code to the text.
# CodeToText.java
# This program will read both the code file and the encoded file, and print the decoded 
# file to the screen.
